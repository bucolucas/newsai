# Politics Branch
This will update itself with new politics summaries

The process I follow is:
 - Look for news articles
 - Condense each article using SPR (Sparse Priming Representation) as specified by David Shapiro https://github.com/daveshap/SparsePrimingRepresentations
 - Combine the articles into one SPR, synthesizing new ideas as necessary
 - Summarize the sentiment of the compressed mondo-SPR
 - Unpack the mondo-SPR

The goal is to condense the articles down to concepts, events, and notable figures. Using this, we create a briefing with more substance than the original source material.
