# Sentiment
- Negative sentiment: The phrasing "financial strife," "criticizes," "risks default," "facing funding challenges," "resigns," "irrevocable leadership issues," "woes," "debt," "blames," "threat," "turmoil," "jeopardized," "struggle," "competence concerns," "ridiculed," "inaccuracies revealed," "contradictory," "decline," and "scrutiny" collectively suggest a broad array of difficulties and controversies surrounding financial issues, party dynamics, and individual actions. The focus on debt, potential selling of assets, and publicized internal conflicts indicate stress and uncertainty within the Michigan GOP and reflect criticisms toward current administration and past leaders.

Biden's appearance at Stellantis shows support for the United Auto Workers, indicating a positive connection and solidarity with labor unions, which is juxtaposed with negative sentiment over his competency highlighted through the "T-shirt struggle" and ridicule on social media.
- Positive sentiment: The narrative of union advocacy, ongoing support from UAW, and optimism about future union jobs in the electric vehicle sector imply a favorable sentiment towards progress in labor and industry. Biden's anecdotes signify an attempt to create a positive, relatable image through personal storytelling and connection to the auto industry.
